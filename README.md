## Inspiration

I've been loving
[`EnergizedProtection`](https://github.com/EnergizedProtection)
and its simplicity of setting it up once
and forgetting about it.  
However, setting up the
[`EnergizedProtection Magisk Module`](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/energizedprotection)
includes executing some shell commands
to download and install the preferred pack.
Additionally, 
their infrastructure was kinda flaky, 
the shellscripts weren't POSIX compliant 
and some other minor inconveniences...

So I've been envisioning a Magisk Module,
which simply can be installed and forgot about.
And with updates simply delivered
via the Magisk inbuilt module updater,
updating is an easy and straight forward process.

The name `MagicalProtection` is inspired by
Magisk's Magic Mount 
and _(obviously)_ by `EnergizedProtection`.

## Usage / Installation

To use this Magisk module, install it and reboot.  
There is nothing more to do, it will work straightaway.  
_Magisk's Systemless Hosts module is not required._
